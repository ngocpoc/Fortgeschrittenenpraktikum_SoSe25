\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:Discussion}
The relative deviation is calculated using the following equation
\begin{equation*}
    \symup{\Delta} x_{\text{rel}} = \left| \frac{x_{\text{exp}} - x_{{\text{theo}}}}{x_{{\text{theo}}}}\right|\,.
\end{equation*}
\subsection{Contrast}
The measured contrast was lower than the theoretically expected contrast throughout the range. The reason for this could be 
that the theoratical contrast was calculated for an ideal system with the beams exactly alligned. This cannot be achieved in 
a real experiment. Furthermore the interefering beams had quite a few fringes when observed. This shows that the beams 
were not entirely parallel and therefor the contrast is lower than idealy. 

\subsection{Refractive index of air}
The theoretical value for the refractive index of air is given as $n_{\text{air, theo}}=1.00027653$. 
In \autoref{sec:Analysis}, the experimental value for the refractive index of air was determined to be 
$n_{\text{air, exp}} = 1.0002770\pm0.0000013$, resulting in a relative deviation of $\symup{\Delta}n_{\text{air}} = 0.00005015\,\%$. 

\subsection{Refractive index of glass}
The refractive index of 
glass depends on the specific material and typically lies within the range $n_{\text{glas, theo}}\in [1.4570, 1.8449]$ at a 
wavelength of $\lambda = \SI{632.990}{\nano\meter}$. 
The experimentally determined refractive index of glass was calculated to be $n_{\text{glass, exp}} = 1.49\pm0.21$ which lies 
well within the expected theoretical range. 
This confirms that the measured value corresponds to a physically plausible glass material.
An explanation for the minor deveations could be that a plexiglass hood was placed over the experimental setup to minimize 
variation of air density.
